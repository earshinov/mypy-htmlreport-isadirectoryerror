== Repro

**A**. Mypy works fine with `-p` and without `--html-report`:

----
$ poetry run mypy -p folder
Success: no issues found in 4 source files
----

**B**. Mypy works fine with `--html-report` and without `-p`:

----
$ poetry run mypy folder --html-report=mypy-report
Generated HTML report (via XSLT): /mnt/c/tmp/mypy-bug/mypy-report/index.html
Success: no issues found in 3 source files

[NOTE]
====
In the real repo I cannot omit `-p` because of errors mypy reports in local namespace packages:

----
ldap_tool/commands/fetch_users.py:10: error: Skipping analyzing ".base": found module but no type hints or library stubs
----
====

**C**. Mypy breaks when passed both `-p` and `--html-report`:

----
$ poetry run mypy -p folder --html-report=mypy-report
